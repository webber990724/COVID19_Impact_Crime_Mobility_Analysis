## **Overview**  
**COVID19 Impact on Crime and Mobility in London** is an open code product designed for spatio-temporal analysis of crime and mobility data during the COVID-19 lockdowns in London. This repository includes:  
- **Data**: Crime data, mobility statistics, and geographic boundaries.  
- **Code**: Python-based Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  
- **Analysis**: Evaluation of changes in crime rates, mobility patterns, and their correlation during lockdowns.  

The product leverages multi-source datasets, including crime records from the Metropolitan Police, mobility data from Googleâ€™s COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, and socio-economic data from the UK Census and Index of Multiple Deprivation. Organized into a Jupyter Notebook, the analysis encompasses exploratory data visualizations, clustering of Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) using DBSCAN, and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) modelling. The findings reveal significant changes in crime patterns, influenced by mobility reductions, land use types, and socio-demographic factors during three critical periods of the pandemic. This open code product provides researchers and policymakers with a comprehensive toolkit for understanding crime dynamics and improving data-driven crime prevention strategies in the context of public health crises.
